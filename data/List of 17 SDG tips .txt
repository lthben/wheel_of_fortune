* In Singapore, resources are dedicated towards people with special needs, ranging from specialised institutions of learning such as MINDS, APSN, Lighthouse School and others, to support and integration with mainstream schools.
* In Singapore, pre-school education is being made affordable and standardised, with the entry of government-run centres that are on-site at primary schools. Financial assistance is provided to defer the costs of private pre-schools as well.
* Apart from traditional tertiary institutions for adult learners, there are programmes offered at the Lifelong Learning Institute and Devan Nair Institute for Employment and Employability to help to cater to the changing needs of the population. 
* SkillsFuture, a Singapore government-led initiative, provides training credits to help with acquisition of skills that are relevant to the industries and gives better access to job opportunities.
* While having one of the world’s highest quality of education, Singapore is high in the rankings in terms of academic-related stress. Parents should recognise that being too focused on the “paper chase” can come at the cost of a holistic education and the well-being of the child. 


SDG5: Gender Equality 
* Gender equality starts at home.
* Women earn 10 to 30 per cent less than men for the same work. Pay inequality persists everywhere. Voice your support for equal pay for equal work.

* Singapore is implementing the ambitious underground Deep Tunnel Sewerage System (DTSS) that criss-crosses the country to channel used water to centralised water reclamation plants. 
* The Sustainable Singapore Blueprint 2015 outlines a national vision and plans for a more liveable and sustainable Singapore. It revolves around the three themes of “a liveable and endearing home”, “a vibrant and sustainable city” and “an active and gracious community”.
* In the late 70’s and 80’s, Singapore cleaned up the highly polluted Singapore River and Kallang Basin and built concrete, utilitarian drains and canals in the fastest ways possible to alleviate and preempt flooding. Now, two thirds of Singapore’s land area are used as rain catchment. 
* In 2006, Singapore’s national water agency, PUB, launched the Active, Beautiful, Clean Waters (ABC Waters) Programme which builds community spaces around water bodies, integrates canals with the urban landscape, and improves water quality by using natural cleansing features. 
* In 2003, Singapore became one of the first countries in the world to make widespread use of reclaimed water, which it calls NEWater. Singapore’s first desalination plant was completed in 2005 by Hyflux.
* Singapore’s substantial investments in water technology has helped create a thriving cluster of about 180 water companies and more than 20 research centres, providing services along the entire water value chain.

SDG12: Responsible consumption and production
* Try to reduce the amount of waste based on your consumption patterns. For helpful tips, check out ZeroWasteSG.com and join the online Facebook Group “Journey to Zero Waste Life in Singapore”. 
* Singapore has only one landfill. Each year, we send about 200,000 tonnes of solid waste and all incineration ash to the Semakau landfill. At this rate we are sending waste there, it will run out of space by around 2035. 
* You can visit Singapore’s only landfill at Palau Semakau to understand how Singapore processes her waste. The National Environment Agency (NEA) sponsors free guided visits to the landfill.
* Packaging waste such as bottles and cans makes up a third of Singapore’s domestic waste by weight. In 2007, NEA launched the Singapore Packaging Agreement (SPA), a voluntary initiative with industry and non-government organisations to reduce packaging waste. 
* To date, signatories of the Singapore Packaging Agreement have cumulatively avoided about 46,000 tonnes of packaging waste, leading to a cumulative savings of over S$100 million dollars.

* When shopping for consumer or industrial products, do look out for the logo for Green Label Singapore by the Singapore Environment Council. This is an ecolabel endorsing the product on its more environmentally-friendly life cycle.
* Recycling paper, plastic, glass & aluminium keeps landfills from filling up.
* Do a bit of online research and buy only from companies that you know have sustainable practices and don’t harm the environment.

* Even as Singapore continues to develop the nation’s solid waste infrastructure, the nation’s waste output is projected to increase. The sustainable solution is to minimise waste and maximise recycling through the practice of the 3Rs (reduce, reuse and recycle). 
* Singapore aims to have a 70% recycling rate by 2030 to help make the vision of working towards a “Zero Waste Nation” a reality.
* About 40% of the items received in the blue recycling bins are not recyclable due to contamination. Do clean the items, using rinse water from dishwashing, before putting them in the bin, especially those with leftover food waste and other organic matter. 
* Not all items are recyclable and can be put into the blue recycling bins. Some examples are ceramics, mirrors, mattresses, luggages, pillows, toys, footwear, beanbags and diapers. Visit www.nea.gov.sg/3R or use the myENV app for more information on what you can recycle.
* Instead of buying a new pram for your baby, do consider renting one with PramShare SG. The sharing economy helps cut down unnecessary waste.
* Instead of using single-use plastics, you can help reduce waste and support local industries at the same time with sustainable products from UNPACKT, The Sustainability Project or The Green Collective.

* While Singapore does not experience major weather events such as typhoons and forest fires, for an island state surrounded by the sea, a rising sea level impacts sea trade and increases maintenance costs at coastal areas. 
* The Ministry of Environment and Water Resources, with the National Environment Agency and Public Utilities Board, have planned to adapt with the changes and combat further damage with campaigns and policies to reduce emissions. 
* The Sustainable Singapore Blueprint 2015 outlines a national vision and plans for a more liveable and sustainable Singapore. It revolves around the three themes of “a liveable and endearing home”, “a vibrant and sustainable city” and “an active and gracious community”.

* The escalating adoption of solar energy in Singapore has opened up new innovation opportunities around smart grid and energy management. It has also strengthened Singapore’s position as the leading clean energy hub in the region, with about 50 solar companies serving the region.


SDG14: Life below water
* Don’t buy jewellery and other items made from corals, tortoise shells or other marine life.
