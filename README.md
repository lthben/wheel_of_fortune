A simple Python program that takes input from a rotary encoder connected to an Arduino via a serial port.

The Tkinter library is used for graphics. Depending on the rotary encoder reading, a tip for 1 of 17 SDGs is shown.

A text file containing the text for all the tips for the 17 SDGs is first processed. 

The logos are downloaded from the UN SDG website.

A counter tracks the tips and increments the counter when that tip is presumably read, so all the tips are shown eventually.

The app is independent of screen size. So any monitor with HDMI can be used.
